# 2020 Summary of Projects

## Calva

* Version 2.0.75 released
  - [Support cljs-suitable JavaScript completion](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/552)
  - [Fix Printing to Calva REPL prints <repl#7> before each print out](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/548)


* Version 2.0.76 released
  - [Fix Calva locking up when opening files with very long lines](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/556)


#### Configuration of Formatting

Calva's formatter can now be configured to support different formatting policies - a big thanks to [nbardiuk](https://github.com/nbardiuk). This is something users have been asking for, and we're excited to offer it now! See [this post](https://clojureverse.org/t/calva-gets-configurable-formatting/5596) for more information.


#### Docs

The [Calva docs](https://calva.io/) have a new look and a new home! We switched to using mkdocs for building our docs and are using the material theme.

#### Debugger

The debugger has been released! [Documentation for the debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/) was written and published that covers the existing functionality and lists current and upcoming features.

I've added a command to instrument functions for debugging as an alternative and more convenient method than adding `#dbg` reader tags to the code file. I've also added editor decorations to visually indicate which functions are instrumented. The instrumented function definitions as well as the usages gain a top and bottom border and a background. clj-kondo is used [as a JVM library](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/jvm.md#api) to get the var definitions and usages, and [this data](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/tree/master/analysis) is matched up with cider-nrepl's [`debug-instrumented-defs`](https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/nrepl-api/ops.html#_debug_instrumented_defs) response data to create the decorations on document change.

The instrument command and decorations features were released and I've started working on displaying structured values, for locals, in the VS Code debugger side pane (currently non-primitives are shown as strings). This should allow a user to "drill down" into a structured value like a map or collection.





## Fireplace

* Worked on issues related to Fireplace
* Retool `:Eval` to support streaming response.
* Implemented sending text to stdin.
* Implemented eval backgrounding.  Press CTRL-D during any interactive eval to
  detach from it and continue using Vim.  The results will open in a preview
  window when finished.
* Phased out internal use of old APIs.





## Reagent

Some of the fixed tests were related to how Reagent added component stack
information into the error messages, which was retrieved from React class component internal properties.

React now provides a proper way to get the component stack information for errors
using Error Boundaries.


I created Reagent 0.10.0 release. This version marks the functions deprecated,
so library authors have some time to fix calls before functions are removed.



Related to the functional render feature, I implemented first version
of providing options to Reagent. This way existing applications can keep
using the old implementation and Class components, and allow users to choose
if they want to try functional components. Additionally a custom component
can be added, which can be used to control per form if Class or functional
component is created. 

Improved the documentation and examples, and added code coverage reporting to CI and Github.


Reagent 1.0.0-alpha1 is out and contains implementation of both
creating React function components from Reagent components
and options.

I added some new documentation pages
and a new example showing making Function components default
and using Hooks with Reagent, and created the first release for testing.

Based on the comments from users, I've already added
two more "shortcuts" to Reagent: `:f>` to create
Function Reagent component (using the default
options), and `:r>` to use React
components without properties conversion done by
`:>` and `adapt-react-class`.

added new test environment for Reagent, using the
new `:bundle` compilation target. This target generates
JS tooling compatible output. This output can be passed to
Webpack, or for testing, Karma.


#### General bug fixes

During implementation of functional components, I've also merged some
previously implemented changes to master, and refactored test checks
to provide better failure messages.





## Ring


The [ADR](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/doc/adr-spec-2.md) for Ring 2.0 has been completed


The servlet interop functions and Jetty adapter have been updated to
support the Ring 2.0 request and response formats. 

Fixed various smaller issues with Ring 1.8.0
 
Ring 2.0.0-alpha1 has been released, with the adapter and servlet
utility functions supporting both Ring 1 and Ring 2 keys by default,
though there is also an option for forcing a particular version.

* Added cider-eval-list-at-point for evaluating code between paired delimiters (lists, vectors, etc)





## Figwheel

* Created some integration [testing](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main-testing) for figwheel-main to track if new releases of ClojureScript break any of the main features.

	These tests launch figwheel and then touch various files to ensure
correct loading in terms of load order and files included in the
reload.

	These tests append various errors to files to ensure the correct error
messages show up as well.

* Got both lein-figwheel and figwheel-main working with the latest CLJS :bundle target

	The new :bundle target is an important improvement in the CLJS
compiler that provides better support for NPM dependencies in web
projects.

	* Updated the Leiningen template for lein-figwheel.

 		- The template now generates a project that supports the new `:bundle` target. One can generate the standard figwheel project by adding a `+no-bundle` option on the command line.
		- Improved the templates CLI option parsing and removed `om` as a generated framework.
* Added the new Figwheel logo and updated the website style of the [Figwheel website](https://figwheel.org)
* Improved the `:bundle` target support in [figwheel-main](https://figwheel.org).
	- This was reflected in the `com.bhaumsn/figwheel-main 0.2.7` release and the newly updated [documentation for working with NPM](https://figwheel.org/docs/npm.html).
* Refactored RNFB and added support for `expo`
* Removed [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) dependence on `js/React` global
* Implemented a `--clean` command which makes it easier to clean your compiled artifacts out of your project.
* Created the [`certifiable`](https://github.com/bhauman/certifiable) library to ease the creation of a local dev certificate and Java Keystore. This should enable `figwheel-main` to have turn-key HTTPS support.
* Added cleaning to `figwheel-main`.  You can either add the `--clean` to your CLI options or or `:clean-ouputs true` to your Figwheel options. 
	- This will clean all of your builds compilation output including generated bundles AND all of the compiled output from and extra-mains that you have configured as well.
* Added a new [`:ssl-valid-hosts`](https://figwheel.org/config-options#ssl-valid-hosts) option will let you configure which hostnames and ips the generated certificate considers valid.
* Completed React Native support. This supports React Native Expo CLI as well.
	- The minimal configuration for a React Native project in `figwheel.main` is now:


      ^{:react-native :cli}
      {:main example.main}

* Released `figwheel.main 0.2.10`
* Fixed bug introduced by a refactor that broke `:connect-url` this
  has been deployed to 0.2.11
* Added a tutorial/doc on how to use Nodejs with Figwheel

## Datahike


#### Datomic API

API documentation were adjusted in order to provide better examples on how to use them. 

The api namespace of Datahike is updated to match the signatures of Datomic, among them the ability to pass queries as string and to transact lazy sequences.

Got the cljdoc api-docs working, which can now be seen on
[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.replikativ/datahike).

Datomic API compatibility was finished up with more tests and the `listen` functionality that allows for callbacks on each transaction. Finally these features were merged with the [PR #240](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/pull/240).


#### Entity Specs

Users can now create new specs with `:db.entity/attrs` and `:db.entity/preds` and assert entities in transactions with `:db/ensure`.

 Older stale branches and PRs were also cleaned out. 


#### Tuple Support

Added 'tuples' to Datahike. It is now possible to declare the three types of tuples
(homogeneous, heterogeneous and composite) in a Datahike schema. As a result Datahike will not only check the conformity of the declaration but also the validity of a tuple related transaction at transaction time. 

Finished transacting and querying homogeneous and heterogeneous.

Implemented composite tuples. 


####  Released 0.3.2

Released version [0.3.2](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/releases/tag/v0.3.2)

- fixed hash computation
- improved printer
- fixed history upsert
- added database name to environ
- added circle ci orbs for ci/cd across all libraries
- fixed reverse schema update
- added automatic releases
- added benchmark utility
- extended time variance test
- updated dependencies
- adjusted documentation


#### Released 0.3.3

Released version [0.3.3](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/releases/tag/v0.3.3)

- Support for tuples (#104)
- Switch to Clojure CLI tools (#253)
- Adapt API namespace for Datomic compatibility (#196)
- Implement query with string (#196)
- Implement transact with lazy sequence (#196, #78, #151)
- Change upsert implementation to - Improve transaction performance (#62)
- Improve cljdoc (#88)
- Format source code according to - Clojure Style Guide (#198)
- Improve benchmark tooling
- Improve documentation on the pull-api namespace


#### Beyond Clojurists Together Tasks

Unified the CI/CD for circleci, moving from leiningen to Clojure CLI tools.

Implemented a garbage collector for hitchhiker-tree based backends.

Updated the
[benchmark suite](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike-benchmark).

Tested and reviewed the
[attribute references](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/pull/236) feature

Worked on a [remote client](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike-client) for [datahike-server](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike-server). 

The ClojureScript port is moving forward focussing on the transactor and query engine.

The [upsert feature](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/pull/201) had to be adjusted and is now benchmarked in order to see which functions take most of the performance.





## Malli

* Fixed issues, closed PRs, polished the code, updated dependencies, updated libraries using malli, curved out bundle size on js, added `type-properties`, rewrote a lot of core code to use it, and wrote alpha release blog post.

* Add utilities for users to easily create simple schemas with property-based validation, including `:min` and `:max` ranges for numbers, collections and dates.
* More built-in schemas: `:int`, `:double`, `:boolean`, `:keyword`, `:symbol`, `:qualified-keyword`, `:qualified-symbol` and `:uuid`

* Handling of Map Schemas is rewritten lifting MapEntry properties as first class concept for schema applications. This includes new entry value schema type (`m/-val-schema`), conditional entry walking and a new reusable syntax parser.

#### Alpha is out!

### Misc

* Studied [Specter Source](https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter/blob/1.0.4/src/clj/com/rpl/specter/navs.cljc#L243-L367) for finding more performant ways for doing value transformations. Good stuff.

Added Code Challenges section, covering the Clojure challenges available in 4Clojure.com, Exercism.io, CodwWars.com, ClojureScript Koans and Advent of Code.  A quick guide to using each of the Code challenge websites was provided and tips to using them effectively.  GitHub code repositories for the Practicalli [4Clojure guides](https://github.com/practicalli/four-clojure/), [codewars-guides](https://github.com/practicalli/codewars-guides) and [exercism-guides](https://github.com/practicalli/exercism-clojure-guides) were included, along with the [4Clojure guides video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiDB_KGrbliCsCUrmcBvdW16) which walks through the solution to over 60 challenges and different approaches to solving them. Several 4Clojure and Exercism challenges have been added as solution walk-through.

Released  high-quality REPL driven development videos.

Updated [Clojure CLI tools version used with CircleCI](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/testing/integration-testing/circle-ci/) and updating scripts to use -M flag with aliases.

Launch Portal data navigator with any REPL using `:env/dev` and `:inspect/portal-cli` aliases. The REPL automatically evaluates the `dev/user.clj` source code file to require portal, open the portal window and add portal as a `tap>` source


#### Clojure WebApps

Continued the [Banking on Clojure project](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure-webapps/projects/banking-on-clojure/database-tables.html)

The application server system, UI, routing and initial handler have been defined and CircleCI used for system integration and generative testing, deploying to a staging environment on Heroku on successful builds.

PostgreSQL provisioned using Heroku for staging and production database.

Added code to create and delete the development database which is called from fixture functions within the handler-helper-test namespace.  The tests now run successfully via the CircleCI service.

Using kaocha profiles to configure different behavior in the development environment and when running on the CI server, specifically file change watcher and test output.


#### Clojure deps.edn

Updated existing aliases.

[Additional aliases added for lambdaisland/kaocha](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn/blob/live/deps.edn#L318-L350) to support ClojureScript test runner, BDD style tests, code coverage and junit-xml reports for CI tools and wall-boards.

Updated and fixed to the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn user level configuration for Clojure CLI tools.

Added clj-kondo as a GitHub action to lint all pull requests and commits, ensuring aliases are in a good state.


#### Practicalli Clojure
Added [several small projects](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/simple-projects/) to help people learn the basics of Clojure.

Added docs to [use CIDER and Calva with REBL](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/data-browsers/rebl-data-visualization.html#configure-rebl-with-cider-for-spacemacs--emacs)


#### Conjure - vim tooling for Clojure development
Expanded the Clojure aware tools recommendations with Conjure, an excellent development environment for Neovim.

Created a [install walk through guide for Conjure](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/6c475137ee57fbb14f9289bd76889512) that supports those new to Neovim. Added  [example init.vim](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/fc7c6ec08d584675105667a0e483a643) configuration that is documented and explains the purpose of the plugins included, supporting the adoption of the Conjure tool.


#### Screencasts

Updated [Cognitect REBL install procedure](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/alternative-tools/clojure-tools/cognitect-rebl.html), local maven install no longer required.

Updated [Conjure configuration](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/6c475137ee57fbb14f9289bd76889512) and documentation


#### Practicalli Spacemacs

Now Emacs 27 is the default, trying out Ligature support in Emacs.  Added the unicode layer with variables to include ligatures.  Initially switching to the Fira code font which contains a wide range of ligatures in the font already.

Changed to the [practicalli/spacemacs.d](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d/) configuration for Spacemacs.

Several custom snippets added to the [practicalli/spacemacs.d](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d/): deprecated and design journal banners, rich code block with clj-kondo ignore duplicate


#### Practicalli Data Science
Created a new (alpha state) book to provide practical guides to using Clojure tools and libraries to build applications in a data science context.  

* [Notespace section](https://practicalli.github.io/data-science/notebooks/notespace/) - created [a simple demo of the Notespace data science journal tool](https://github.com/practicalli/scicloj-notespace-simple-demo) for Clojure, combined with Portal to help browse large data sets.



##### Hacking CIDER

[Hacking on CIDER live broadcast](https://youtu.be/XuquYgOSOnc) to evolve the way cider-jack-in manages aliases. Covers basic elisp print line style debugging and how to hack on the live Cider code running in Emacs.

* [PR #2926](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/2926) - Tip to evaluate namespace before documentation lookup - added to Practicalli Spacemacs instead.






# Calva

* Made a change to clojure-lsp to [make references code lens work](https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp/pull/197)
* Added a command to Calva to make references code lens work. When references code lenses are clicked, a peek definitions window opens.
* Added a Calva setting to enable references code lens
* Fixed an issue in clojure-lsp to [prevent negative numbers in ranges](https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp/pull/200)


## Clojure-lsp Work
- [Fix jar file URIs to be compatible with both Windows and Unix](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/pull/226)
- [Add initialization options that allow disabling formatting providers](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/pull/207)
- [Fix go id for documentHighlight](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/pull/212)
- [Fix duplicated usages/references for cljc files](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/pull/211)
* Added refactoring commands that utilize clojure-lsp's refactorings as well as updated the docs to [explain clojure-lsp in Calva](https://calva.io/clojure-lsp/) and the [refactoring commands](https://calva.io/refactoring/).
* Added a change to Clojure-lsp to prevent the process from being orphaned. If VS Code was killed in a certain time window while Clojure-lsp was initializing, the process would be left running. Now Clojure-lsp periodically checks if the parent process is alive and will exit if not. This is a suggested feature of servers by the language server protocol. 
* Fixed an issue with the default classpath lookup for Windows.
* Replaced the usage of clj-kondo with clojure-lsp. This allowed us to remove clj-kondo as an injected jack-in dependency.


## Calva Changes


Calva now uses clj-kondo via clojure-lsp, and no longer bundles the clj-kondo extension. This reduces Calva's indirect memory footprint as opposed to the previous setup of using clojure-lsp and the clj-kondo extension, since the clj-kondo extension runs its own LSP server, which is no longer necessary.

# O’Doyle Rules

* Released version [0.5.0](https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules/releases/tag/0.5.0)
	* An easy way to request all facts in a session via `(query-all session)`, mainly intended for serialization. You can parse them later and re-insert them into your session.
	* A new block type called `:then-finally`, which lets you react to insertions *and* retractions that affect a rule's matches. This is vital for creating "derived facts" that accumulate other facts -- which is my equivalent to Clara's [accumulators](https://www.clara-rules.org/docs/accumulators/).
	* Added several benchmarks to the repo.

* Released version [0.6.0](https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules/releases/tag/0.6.0)
	* Made it possible for rules to build recursive data structures similar to what you'd get from "pull" queries in DataScript or Datomic. Here's an in-depth explanation: [Using O'Doyle Rules as a poor man's DataScript](https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules/blob/master/bench-src/todos/README.md).

* Implemented a common optimization called "node sharing". Rules that pulled in similar data now could share nodes internally, avoiding duplicated effort. 
* Wrote a [section in the README](https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules#performance) about how to use derived facts in this way. When I applied this technique to the "dungeon" benchmark, it went from ~1700 ms to ~1100 ms -- an even better improvement than from node sharing. The [dungeon crawler game](https://github.com/oakes/play-cljc-examples/tree/master/dungeon-crawler) improved by 5 FPS with the same technique.





# ClojisR

* Used a wide range of Clojure data science libraries (mainly Tablecloth, tech.ml.dataset, dtype-next, ClojisR, Vega+Hanami, Fastmath, Notespace) to translate code samples under the Data Wrangling section of [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html) and Data Exploration section of [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html) covering the following topics:
  - Tibbles (Dataframes)
  - Data import
  - Tidy data
  - Relational data
  - Strings
  - Dates and times
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Transformation
  - Exploratory Data Analysis


* The above translation allowed us to compare the current Clojure data science ecosystem with the R ecosystem and helped us figure out the functionality which was missing and the features which could be made more user-friendly. These points were discussed with the relevant library authors (mainly Tablecloth, ClojisR, Notespace, dtype-next) and various GitHub issues were opened for feature requests as well as bug fixes.
